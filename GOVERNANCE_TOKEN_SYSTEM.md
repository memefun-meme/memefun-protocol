# Governance Token System

## Overview

The Solana Memes platform implements a **token-based governance system** that activates when the protocol's native governance token (`SOLANA_MEMES`) is deployed. This ensures that governance decisions are made by token holders who have a vested interest in the platform's success.

## Governance Token Details

### ü™ô **Token Specifications**
- **Name**: SOLANA_MEMES
- **Symbol**: SMEME
- **Decimals**: 9
- **Total Supply**: 500,000,000 (500 million tokens)
- **Initial Distribution**: Controlled by platform authority
- **Voting Power**: 1 token = 1 vote

### üèõÔ∏è **Governance Parameters**
- **Minimum Voting Power**: 1,000 tokens (0.0002% of supply)
- **Quorum Requirement**: 10% of total supply (50 million tokens)
- **Voting Period**: 7 days
- **Execution Delay**: 24 hours after approval
- **Emergency Threshold**: 1% of total supply (5 million tokens)

## Governance Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Pre-Governance (Current State)
```
Platform Launch ‚Üí Basic Operations ‚Üí Token Deployment ‚Üí Governance Activation
```

**Current Limitations:**
- Fee changes require authority approval only
- No community voting mechanism
- Placeholder governance system
- Limited decentralization

### Phase 2: Token Deployment
```
Deploy Governance Token ‚Üí Initial Distribution ‚Üí Activate Governance ‚Üí Full DAO
```

**Activation Requirements:**
- Governance token deployed
- Minimum 10% of supply distributed (50M tokens)
- Authority activates governance system
- Community can start voting

## Token Distribution Strategy

### üìä **Initial Allocation**
```
Total Supply: 500,000,000 SMEME
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Community Rewards: 40% (200M tokens)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Platform Treasury: 25% (125M tokens)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Team & Development: 15% (75M tokens)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Liquidity Mining: 10% (50M tokens)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Marketing & Partnerships: 5% (25M tokens)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Emergency Reserve: 5% (25M tokens)
```

### üéØ **Distribution Methods**
1. **Staking Rewards**: Earn tokens by staking memecoins
2. **Liquidity Mining**: Provide liquidity to earn tokens
3. **Community Airdrops**: Reward early adopters
4. **Treasury Grants**: Fund community projects
5. **Team Vesting**: Gradual release over 2 years

## Governance Features

### üó≥Ô∏è **Voting System**
- **Token-Based Voting**: 1 token = 1 vote

- **Snapshot Voting**: Vote based on token balance at proposal creation
- **Multiple Vote Types**: Yes, No, Abstain

### üìã **Proposal Types**
1. **Fee Changes**: Adjust trading fees (0.5% - 2.0%)
2. **Token Creation**: Modify token creation parameters
3. **Buyback Config**: Update buyback mechanisms
4. **Treasury Allocation**: Spend treasury funds
5. **Governance Rules**: Modify governance parameters
6. **Emergency Actions**: Emergency measures

### ‚è∞ **Governance Timeline**
```

    pub is_delegated: bool,
    pub delegate: Option<Pubkey>,
    pub created_at: i64,

}
```

#### GovernanceProposal
```rust
pub struct GovernanceProposal {
    pub id: u64,
    pub creator: Pubkey,
    pub title: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub proposal_type: ProposalType,
    pub start_time: i64,
    pub end_time: i64,
    pub yes_votes: u64,
    pub no_votes: u64,
    pub total_votes: u64,
    pub quorum_required: u64,
    pub quorum_met: bool,
    pub executed: bool,
    pub executed_at: Option<i64>,
    pub executed_by: Option<Pubkey>,
    pub created_at: i64,
    pub updated_at: i64,
}
```

### Key Instructions

#### 1. Deploy Governance Token
```rust
pub fn deploy_governance_token(ctx: Context<DeployGovernanceToken>) -> Result<()>
```
- Initializes governance token mint
- Sets up governance configuration
- Prepares for token distribution

#### 2. Activate Governance
```rust
pub fn activate_governance(ctx: Context<ActivateGovernance>) -> Result<()>
```
- Activates governance system
- Requires minimum token distribution
- Enables community voting

#### 3. Create Proposal
```rust
pub fn create_proposal(
    ctx: Context<CreateGovernanceProposal>,
    title: String,
    description: String,
    proposal_type: ProposalType,
) -> Result<()>
```
- Creates new governance proposal
- Requires minimum voting power
- Sets voting period and quorum

#### 4. Vote on Proposal
```rust
pub fn vote(ctx: Context<VoteOnProposal>, vote_type: VoteType) -> Result<()>
```
- Records individual votes
- Updates proposal vote counts
- Checks quorum requirements

#### 5. Execute Proposal
```rust
pub fn execute_proposal(ctx: Context<ExecuteProposal>) -> Result<()>
```
- Executes approved proposals
- Implements governance decisions
- Records execution details

## Governance Workflow Example

### Fee Change Proposal
```
1. Token Holder (1K+ tokens) creates fee change proposal
2. 7-day voting period begins
3. Community votes (Yes/No/Abstain)
4. If quorum met (10% of supply = 50M tokens) and majority Yes:
   - 24-hour execution delay
   - Fee change implemented
   - All trading fees updated
```

### Treasury Allocation Proposal
```
1. Community member proposes spending treasury funds
2. Detailed proposal with budget and timeline
3. Community votes on allocation
4. If approved: funds released to specified address
5. Proposal execution recorded on-chain
```

## Conclusion

The governance token system transforms the Solana Memes platform from an authority-controlled system to a **community-driven DAO**. This ensures:

- **Long-term Sustainability**: Community ownership and alignment
- **Decentralized Decision Making**: Democratic governance structure
- **Value Accrual**: Token holders benefit from platform success
- **Transparency**: All decisions recorded and verifiable
- **Security**: Robust protection mechanisms

The transition from the current placeholder governance to a full token-based system represents a significant milestone in the platform's evolution toward true decentralization.
