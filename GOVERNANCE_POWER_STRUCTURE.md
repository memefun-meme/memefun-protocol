# Governance Power Structure Analysis

## 🎯 **Two-Tier Governance System**

Our platform implements a **two-tier governance system** with distinct powers for different staker types:

## 📊 **Individual Meme Token Stakers Governance Power**

### **What They Can Decide On:**

#### **1. Token-Specific Decisions**
```rust
// Individual token governance powers
pub struct IndividualTokenGovernance {
    // Token-specific parameters
    pub token_trading_fee: u8,           // Adjust trading fee for their token (0.5% - 2.0%)
    pub token_staking_rewards: u8,        // Adjust staking reward rates
    pub token_creator_share: u8,          // Adjust creator reward percentage
    pub token_community_fund: u8,         // Allocate community fund usage
    
    // Token-specific features
    pub enable_token_buybacks: bool,      // Enable/disable buybacks for their token
    pub token_marketing_budget: u64,      // Allocate marketing budget
    pub token_partnerships: bool,         // Approve token partnerships
    pub token_listing_criteria: bool,     // Set listing criteria for their token
}
```

#### **2. Community Decisions**
```rust
// Community governance powers
pub struct CommunityGovernance {
    // Community fund allocation
    pub community_fund_usage: CommunityFundUsage,
    pub marketing_initiatives: bool,      // Approve marketing campaigns
    pub community_events: bool,           // Approve community events
    pub charity_donations: bool,          // Approve charity donations
    
    // Community features
    pub community_challenges: bool,       // Enable community challenges
    pub referral_programs: bool,          // Adjust referral programs
    pub community_rewards: bool,          // Set community reward structures
}
```

#### **3. Token Economics**
```rust
// Token economics governance
pub struct TokenEconomicsGovernance {
    // Vesting schedules
    pub creator_vesting: bool,            // Adjust creator vesting
    pub team_vesting: bool,               // Adjust team vesting
    pub community_vesting: bool,          // Adjust community vesting
    
    // Token distribution
    pub token_allocation: bool,           // Adjust token allocation
    pub staking_periods: bool,            // Set staking lock periods
    pub reward_distribution: bool,        // Adjust reward distribution
}
```

### **Voting Power Calculation:**
```rust
// Individual token voting power
pub fn calculate_individual_voting_power(
    staked_amount: u64,
    staking_duration: u64,
    community_contribution: u64,
) -> u64 {
    let base_power = staked_amount;
    let duration_multiplier = 1 + (staking_duration / 30); // +1 per month
    let contribution_bonus = community_contribution * 2; // 2x for contributions
    
    base_power * duration_multiplier + contribution_bonus
}
```

### **Example Individual Token Governance:**
```
$DOGECAT Token Governance:

Stakers can vote on:
├── Trading Fee: 0.8% → 1.2% (increase for more rewards)

    smeme_staked: u64,
    staking_duration: u64,
    governance_participation: u64,
    delegation_power: u64,
) -> u64 {
    let base_power = smeme_staked;
    let duration_multiplier = 1 + (staking_duration / 30); // +1 per month
    let participation_bonus = governance_participation * 3; // 3x for participation
    let delegation_bonus = delegation_power * 2; // 2x for delegation
    
    base_power * duration_multiplier + participation_bonus + delegation_bonus
